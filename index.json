The html_vignette output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible. The html_vignette format:\n Never uses retina figures Has a smaller default figure size Uses a custom CSS stylesheet instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap style  Vignette Info Note the various macros within the vignette section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the title field and the \\VignetteIndexEntry to match the title of your vignette.\nStyles The html_vignette template includes a basic CSS theme. To override this theme you can specify your own CSS in the document metadata as follows:\noutput: rmarkdown::html_vignette: css: mystyles.css  Figures The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side.\nplot(1:10) plot(10:1)  You can enable figure captions by fig_caption: yes in YAML:\noutput: rmarkdown::html_vignette: fig_caption: yes  Then you can use the chunk option fig.cap = \u0026quot;Your figure caption.\u0026quot; in knitr.\nMore Examples You can write math expressions, e.g. \\(Y = X\\beta + \\epsilon\\), footnotes1, and tables, e.g. using knitr::kable().\n    mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb     Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4   Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4   Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1   Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1   Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2   Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1   Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4   Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2   Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2   Merc 280 19.2 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30 1 0 4 4    Also a quote using \u0026gt;:\n \u0026ldquo;He who gives up [code] safety for [code] speed deserves neither.\u0026rdquo; (via)\n  A footnote here. ^   ","date":1585267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585267200,"objectID":"9b239c768c401aaaeecd8ae15f75a775","permalink":"/notebook/vignette/","publishdate":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/notebook/vignette/","section":"notebook","summary":"Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages.
